========

This module implements a tracker algorithm that maps detections to tracklets.

.. math::

    Tracker: Detections \rightarrow Tracklets

Each detection has fields that can be used to assign IDs from Tracklets in the
previous frame to Tracklets in the current frame.

Terminology
-----------

- **Detections**: All detected structures at the current frame.

- **Tracklets**: All detections from previous frames, each having a unique track ID.

- **Assignment**: The process that assigns each Detection to a Tracklet.

- **Lost**: The state of a Tracklet that has not been assigned to a detection at the current
    or a previous frame.
